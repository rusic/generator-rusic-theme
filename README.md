# generator-rusic-theme
> A [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) generator to build base Rusic themes.


## Getting Started

```bash
$ npm install -g yeoman
$ npm install -g generator-rusic-theme
$ mkdir rusic-theme-forum
$ cd rusic-theme-forum
$ yo rusic-theme
```

> Run the above to initiate the generator

It will then ask you a few questions, here are a few customisations you can make

- coffeescript or javascript
- scss or css
- API key setup

It also sets up a nice workflow with gulp :)
